# Welcome to Introduction to Computing for Biologists

- Introductions

- Survey

- Syllabus Overview and Questions
	- Assignments due Mondays at _noon_ each week.
	- Class will focus on pragmatics of computing.
	- Plagiarism
		- Searching for solutions online will probably be necessary at some point, but credit must be given.
    		- The same plagiarism rules apply to code as would apply to a written assignment

- GitHub and Homework
	- Repositories
		- Collections of related files (often code)
		- Formalizing as a repository allows Git to keep track of changes you make in these files through time
    - All class notes and assignments
    
- Markdown and Outlines
	- Can take notes directly in file - maybe use block quotes?
    
> This is a block quote.
> This might be an easy way to add your own notes.<br>
> To write notes on new lines, add two empty spaces or `<br>` at the end of a line.
